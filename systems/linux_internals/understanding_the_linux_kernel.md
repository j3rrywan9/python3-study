# Understanding the Linux Kernel, 3rd Edition

## Chapter 1 Introduction

Linux was initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as an operating system for IBM-compatible personal computers based on the Intel 80386 microprocessor.

Technically speaking, Linux is a true Unix kernel, although it is not a full Unix operating system because it does not include all the Unix applications, such as filesystem utilities, windowing systems and    graphical desktops, system administrator commands, text editors, compilers, and so on.

### Linux Versus Other Unix-Like Kernels

To define a common user interface, Unix-like kernels often share fundamental design ideas and features.
In this respect, Linux is comparable with the other Unix-like operating systems.

### Hardware Dependency

Linux tries to maintain a neat distinction between hardware-dependent and hardware-independent source code.
To that end, both the arch and the include directories include 23 subdirectories that correspond to the different types of hardware platforms supported.

### Linux Versions

Please be aware that the kernel version described in this book is Linux 2.6.11.

### Basic Operating System Concepts

The operating system must fulfill two main objectives:
* Interact with the hardware components, servicing all low-level programmable elements included in the hardware platform.
* Provide an execution environment to the applications that run on the computer system (the so-called user programs).

Some operating systems allow all user programs to directly play with the hardware components (a typical example is MS-DOS).
In contrast, a Unix-like operating system hides all low-level details concerning the physical organization of the computer from applications run by the user.
When a program wants to use a hardware resource, it must issue a request to the operating system.
The kernel evaluates the request and, if it chooses to grant the resource, interacts with the proper hardware components on behalf of the user program.

To enforce this mechanism, modern operating systems rely on the availability of specific hardware features that forbid user programs to directly interact with low-level hardware components or to access arbitrary memory locations.
In particular, the hardware introduces at least two different *execution modes* for the CPU: a nonprivileged mode for user programs and a privileged mode for the kernel.
Unix calls these *User Mode* and *Kernel Mode*, respectively.

#### Multiuser Systems

A *multiuser system* is a computer that is able to concurrently and independently execute several applications belonging to two or more users.
*Concurrently* means that applications can be active at the same time and contend for the various resources such as CPU, memory, hard disks, and so on.
*Independently* means that each application can perform its task with no concern for what the applications of the other users are doing.
Switching from one application to another, of course, slows down each of them and affects the response time seen by the users.
Many of the complexities of modern operating system kernels, which we will examine in this book, are present to minimize the delays enforced on each program and to provide the user with responses that are as fast as possible.

Multiuser operating systems must include several features:
* An authentication mechanism for verifying the user's identity
* A protection mechanism against buggy user programs that could block other applications running in the system
* A protection mechanism against malicious user programs that could interfere with or spy on the activity of other users
* An accounting mechanism that limits the amount of resource units assigned to each user

To ensure safe protection mechanisms, operating systems must use the hardware protection associated with the CPU privileged mode.
Otherwise, a user program would be able to directly access the system circuitry and overcome the imposed bounds.
Unix is a multiuser system that enforces the hardware protection of system resources.

#### Users and Groups

#### Processes

All operating systems use one fundamental abstraction: the *process*.
A process can be defined either as "an instance of a program in execution" or as the "execution context" of a running program.
In traditional operating systems, a process executes a single sequence of instructions in an address space;
the address space is the set of memory addresses that the process is allowed to reference.
Modern operating systems allow processes with multiple execution flows â€” that is, multiple sequences of instructions executed in the same address space.

Multiuser systems must enforce an execution environment in which several processes can be active concurrently and contend for system resources, mainly the CPU.
Systems that allow concurrent active processes are said to be *multiprogramming* or *multiprocessing*.

On uniprocessor systems, just one process can hold the CPU, and hence just one execution flow can progress at a time.
In general, the number of CPUs is always restricted, and therefore only a few processes can progress at once.
An operating system component called the *scheduler* chooses the process that can progress.
Some operating systems allow only *nonpreemptable* processes, which means that the scheduler is invoked only when a process voluntarily relinquishes the CPU.
But processes of a multiuser system must be preemptable;
the operating system tracks how long each process holds the CPU and periodically activates the scheduler.

Unix is a multiprocessing operating system with preemptable processes.
Even when no user is logged in and no application is running, several system processes monitor the peripheral devices.
In particular, several processes listen at the system terminals waiting for user logins.
When a user inputs a login name, the listening process runs a program that validates the user password.
If the user identity is acknowledged, the process creates another process that runs a shell into which commands are entered.
When a graphical display is activated, one process runs the window manager, and each window on the display is usually run by a separate process.
When a user creates a graphics shell, one process runs the graphics windows and a second process runs the shell into which the user can enter the commands.
For each user command, the shell process creates another process that executes the corresponding program.
