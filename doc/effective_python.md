# Effective Python

## Pythonic Thinking

It's important for you to know the best - the *Pythonic* - way to do the most common things in Python.
These patterns will affect every program you write.

### Item 1: Know which version of Python you're using

Many computers come with multiple versions of the standard CPython runtime preinstalled.
To find out exactly which version of Python you're using, you can use the `--version` flag:
```bash
$ python --version
```

You can also figure out the version of Python you're using at runtime by inspecting values in the `sys` built-in module:
```python
import sys
print(sys.version_info)
print(sys.version)
```

### Item 2: Follow the PEP 8 style guide

Python Enhancement Proposal #8, otherwise known as PEP 8, is the style guide for how to format Python code.
You are welcome to write Python code any way you want, as long as it has valid syntax.
However, using a consistent style makes your code more approachable and easier to read.
Sharing a common style with other Python programmers in the larger community facilitates collaboration on projects.

#### Whitespace

#### Naming

PEP 8 suggests unique styles of naming for different parts in the language.
These conventions make it easy to distinguish which type corresponds to each name when reading code.
Follow these guidelines related to naming:
* Functions, variables, and attributes should be in `lowercase_underscore` format.
* Instance methods in classes should use `self`, which refers to the object, as the name of the first parameter.
* Class methods should use `cls`, which refers to the class, as the name of the first parameter.

#### Expressions and Statements

#### Imports

### Item 4: Prefer interpolated f-strings over C-style format strings and `str.format`

#### Interpolated Format Strings

### Item 5: Write helper functions instead of complex expressions

As soon as expressions get complicated, it's time to consider splitting them into smaller pieces and moving logic into helper functions.
What you gain in readability always outweighs what brevity may have afforded you.
Avoid letting Python's pithy syntax for complex expressions from getting you into a mess like this.
Follow the *DRY principle*: Don't repeat yourself.

### Item 6: Prefer multiple assignment unpacking over indexing

### Item 7: Prefer `enumerate` over `range`

### Item 8: Use `zip` to process iterators in parallel

### Item 9: Avoid `else` blocks after `for` and `while` loops

### Item 10: Prevent repetition with assignment expressions

An assignment expression â€” also known as the *walrus operator* - is a new syntax introduced in Python 3.8 to solve a long-standing problem with the language that can cause code duplication.
Whereas normal assignment statements are written `a = b `and pronounced "a equals b", these assignments are written `a := b` and pronounced "a walrus b" (because `:=` looks like a pair of eyeballs and tusks).

Assignment expressions are useful because they enable you to assign variables in places where assignment statements are disallowed, such as in the conditional expression of an `if` statement.
An assignment expression's value evaluates to whatever was assigned to the identifier on the left side of the walrus operator.

## Lists and Dictionaries

### Item 11: Know how to slice sequences

Python includes syntax for *slicing* sequences into pieces.
Slicing allows you to access a subset of a sequence's items with minimal effort.
The simplest uses for slicing are the built-in types `list`, `str`, and `bytes`.
Slicing can be extended to any Python class that implements the __getitem__ and __setitem__ special methods

### Item 12

### Item 13

### Item 14: Sort by complex criteria using the `key` parameter

### Item 15

### Item 16: Prefer `get` over `in` and `KeyError` to handle missing dictionary keys

The three fundamental operations for interacting with dictionaries are accessing, assigning, and deleting keys and their associated values.
The contents of dictionaries are dynamic, and thus it's entirely possible - even likely - that when you try to access or delete a key, it won't already be present.

This flow of fetching a key that exists or returning a default value is so common that the `dict` built-in type provides the `get` method to accomplish this task.
The second parameter to `get` is the default value to return in the case that the key - the first parameter - isn't present.

## Functions

### Item 19

### Item 20: Prefer raising exceptions to returning `None`

### Item 21: Know how closures interact with variable scope
